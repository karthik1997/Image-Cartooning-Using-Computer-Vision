# Image-Cartooning-Using-Computer-Vision


## Problem Definition

The Project Aims to Convert Realworld Images to a cantoon effect with the help of computer vision techniques. Lots of researches are there in Deep Learning and Generative Modelling for the same work. Hence it requires more computation to process and least efficient when compaired with time. The proposed system will work on CPUand is optimized for low end devices too. So it is very time saving.

## How to Run?
```
python3 cartoonify.py

```

To execute with a custom image run:

``` 
python3 cartoonify.py --image <path to image>

```

Jupyter Notebook Version is also Availiable.
